# 100 - Introduction

Every web service and static site on render automatically gets a free ```onrender.com``` address which does not change.

But you can also bring your own domains to Render easily. We handle TLS certificate creation and renewal, as well as automatic HTTP and HTTPS redirects for all your custom domains, including wild card domains. Let's learn how to setup ypour domains on Render!

**NOTE** Starting February 1, 2022, we'll begin charging $0.60 per custom domain per month **beyond the first 25 custom domains** for a web service or static site. The first 25 custom domains for web services and static sites will continue to be free.
